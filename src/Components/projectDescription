This project is an Instagram Clone.
It is made for modbile device and is responsive around all the mobile devices.

It shows the upser's display pic with the details of 
posts, followers ect and a follow button.
It shows the Name and Bio of the user just like in Instagram.

It has a button to call the user.

It has a gallery of images uploaded by the user.
I have hardcoded the data in the code but normally this data should be fetched from api and displayed on the UI.

It has a fixed div as in Instagram towards the bottom.

Functionality -

Upon clicking on any image in the image gallery, a new modal opens up to show the bigger size of the image along with details like number of likes and comments.

Upon clicking on likes or the image the likes will increase by 1.(The likes should be fetched from and saved into the database)

There is a input section with a post button to post the comments.

The page is scrollable as in instagram.
